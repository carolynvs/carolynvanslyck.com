Agenda
  Who this is for? - beginner contributors, members looking to move up to maintainers
  What am I going to talk about or rather NOT talk about
  - no contribute to a project in 2 hours type deal
  - real talk about what it's like to work on OSS, what to expect beyond a first pr
Why Open Source
 - it won't help get you a job
 - it won't be terribly fulfilling at times
 - you will meet people in the community
 - you will become better at collaboration, or you won't last long
Contribution Ladder
