If I had never gone to that OYE, I doubt I would be here today. I would have
stayed in a toxic, narrow minded space that was slowly poisoning me. I wouldn't have
discovered my passion for building communities. I'd still be a really good developer,
but there are so many things that I find fulfilling, that give me a purpose in life,
that I wouldn't have right now.

This didn't happen overnight. It was a journey of discoveries. That I loved speaking
at conferences, meeting people and hearing abut what they were excited about.
I didn't go from 0 to some intimidating list of reasons why I'm cool. I did one thing
at a time, tried it out, decided if it was something that made me happy, and kept
building on my success. Sometimes it was deliberate, sometimes I stopped and enjoyed
where I was.

W/S/C showed me successful confident people who were doing things
I had never dreamed possible. It gave me something to strive for.

I want to build the communities that I really needed when I first started.
I mentor because I didn't have that. I mentor because one way for me to surround myself
with amazing diverse people is to help bring them in myself and help them stick around.
I mentor because for every person that I help, that I provide a sustainable example
for how to get along in the community, I see people take that and apply it themselves.

I wanted the company I worked for to support the causes that I so strongly believed in.
Asked around until I met Allison Krug, with Azure Advocates. The Cloud Developer Advocates
are pretty cool because they embody everything that W/S/C teaches us. The CDAs are
all established senior developers who don't just write code in the dark, but are
highly visible leaders in the community. They speak at conferences, run workshops,
answer community questions in all sorts of places, they support local meetups, they
work in open source. They are an elite group of role models. And they are now sponsors
of Write/Speak/Code. Not because it makes Microsoft look good, but because every one of
them don't just value the same things, but live and share these values in our communities.

W/S/C can be overwhelming. You don't have to come from this looking to change your
career and your life. You don't have to spend every weekend writing blog posts,
or jumping from conf to conf. Every step has value and the first step is acknowledging
that you, right now, just as you are, are precious and valuable.

Some advice you can act on now to improve your situation:
becoming more visible at work, meeting new people at conferences, demonstrating
your leadership and skills through your writing. Others you can keep in the back
of your mind, because it may come in handy later as your career evolves. If nothing
else, meet people, share your experiences, learn from theirs, keep in touch. Know
that you aren't alone, help keep each other in the game, resetting the "is this normal" bar,
and looking to each other for support.
