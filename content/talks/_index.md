    Learn how to add custom commands to kubectl and write your first plugin. If you have written a bash script that extracts data from kubectl output, then you are already halfway there! Plugins can add powerful new commands to interact with Kubernetes, saving you time and keystrokes. This session will showcase lessons learned from our development of a kubectl plugin for the Kubernetes Service Catalog.</p>

    <p class="description">Whether you are a Kubernetes user looking to script common commands, a developer building custom Kubernetes resources, or a provider looking to encapsulate specific functionality for your users, come learn how to write your own custom commands using kubectl plugins.</p>

      You may not realize it but there are a lot of Windows developers moving into your neighborhood.
      They are using and contributing to open source projects, even those that aren't just for Windows.
      But here's the rub: Often tools are written Unix first", shoehorning Windows support in later.
      This approach can shut out potential users.

      Lucky for us, Go has strong support for cross-platform development. So let's start writing cross-platform first and welcome our Windows

      There is much more to Docker than just deploying your flagship application. Carolyn VanSlyck, Ash Wilson, and Nick Silkey look at three use cases for Docker that go beyond the typical software development pipeline:
    </p>
<ol class="description">
  <li>The Rackspace Cloud DNS product team is running a Hubot-based ChatOps bot on Carina to automate routine operational tasks in the open via a team-based chat. The team successfully migrated this service from another provider into Carina in under an hour from start to finish, including a datastore migration. (Nick Silkey @ 2:55)</li>

  <li>Rackspaceâ€™s developer documentation is open to external contributors and has streamlined the editing process with a staging environment that previews the full site on-demand for pull requests. All of its infrastructure is hosted within Docker containers, managed by Ansible, on a CoreOS cluster. (Ash Wilson @ 13:57)</li>

  <li style="font-weight: bold">How to Whale is teaching Docker with zero setup from the comfort of your web browser. Every user has an interactive sandbox, courtesy of JupyterHub, which spins up a Jupyter server on the userâ€™s own Docker Swarm cluster. (Carolyn Van Slyck @ 24:32)</li>
</ol>
    <p class="description">
      Youâ€™ll leave knowing how you can use Docker on the side, even if you havenâ€™t tackled Dockerizing your application.

        Jupyter is an exciting tool, empowering you to quickly dive into the fun parts of whatever problem you are solving. With it, you can do so much more than just your research. By combining JupyterHub with Carina, you have a learning platform, perfect for leading a workshop, trying a new language or just playing around with code. It provides push button user notebooks, where each user is not only isolated from others, but they are running on their own compute resources and can hit the "reset" button at any time to start fresh.</p>
