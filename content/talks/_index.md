      Would you like to attract new contributors to your project and grow your contributor base? CNCF SIG Contributor Strategy has developed best practices to improve your contributor pipeline and can help you adapt them to your project‚Äôs needs.
    </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Attract new contributors to your project with good first issues.</li>
    <li>Create onboarding materials, such as a contributing guide and onboarding tutorial, to guide their first  <li>contribution towards success.</li>
    <li>Improve the contributor experience, encouraging people to join your community and stick around after their first pull request.</li>
    <li>Publish a contribution ladder so they see a path from new contributor to maintainer and other project roles.</li>
    <li>Find a balance between your time commitments as a maintainer and helping new contributors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="description">
    Whether you are a new sandbox project or an established graduated projects like Kubernetes, you will come away with a realistic actionable way to sustainably grow your community.

      At each stage from Sandbox to Graduated, you‚Äôll need to add community and process documentation 
      ‚Äì and there‚Äôs even more that‚Äôs good to have even if it‚Äôs not required. Let us help you create

      Can you deploy your entire app from scratch with a Helm install? Or do you
      have cloud infra and hosted services that you rely on? The cloudy bits that make
      your app cloud native.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Cloud Native Application Bundles, the CNAB spec, was designed to solve
      deployment problems that we all have been quietly battling with, mostly with
      hope and bash. Bundles come in handy when deploying applications that don't live
      neatly inside of just Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Let's learn when bundles make sense, when they don't, and what your day could
      look like if you were using them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install tools to manage your app: helm, aws/azure/gcloud, terraform.</li>
      <li>Deploy your app along with its infra: cloud storage, dns entry, load balancer, ssl cert.</li>
      <li>Get software and its dependencies into airgapped networks.</li>
      <li>Manage disparate operational tech, such as Helm or Terraform, across teams and departments.</li>
      <li>Secure your pipeline.</li>
    </ul>

    It is a joy to build command-line tools that are not only easy to learn, but
    that other developers are willing to maintain. Often a team's engineering
    efforts are spent on the backend, while the cli doesn't receive the same
    level of attention. This can result in hard-to-test tools, and dumping
    maintenance of them to whoever most recently joined the team.

      They are using and contributing to open source projects, even those that aren't just for Windows.

      There is much more to Docker than just deploying your flagship application. Carolyn VanSlyck, Ash Wilson, and Nick Silkey look at three use cases for Docker that go beyond the typical software development pipeline:
    </p>
<ol class="description">
  <li>The Rackspace Cloud DNS product team is running a Hubot-based ChatOps bot on Carina to automate routine operational tasks in the open via a team-based chat. The team successfully migrated this service from another provider into Carina in under an hour from start to finish, including a datastore migration. (Nick Silkey @ 2:55)</li>

  <li>Rackspace‚Äôs developer documentation is open to external contributors and has streamlined the editing process with a staging environment that previews the full site on-demand for pull requests. All of its infrastructure is hosted within Docker containers, managed by Ansible, on a CoreOS cluster. (Ash Wilson @ 13:57)</li>

  <li style="font-weight: bold">How to Whale is teaching Docker with zero setup from the comfort of your web browser. Every user has an interactive sandbox, courtesy of JupyterHub, which spins up a Jupyter server on the user‚Äôs own Docker Swarm cluster. (Carolyn Van Slyck @ 24:32)</li>

        Jupyter is an exciting tool, empowering you to quickly dive into the fun parts of whatever problem you are solving. With it, you can do so much more than just your research. By combining JupyterHub with Carina, you have a learning platform, perfect for leading a workshop, trying a new language or just playing around with code. It provides push button user notebooks, where each user is not only isolated from others, but they are running on their own compute resources and can hit the "reset" button at any time to start fresh.</p>
