title: Adventures in Gopher Source
---

I work in OSS because I enjoy collaborating with people. I've made friendships
across the globe that are stronger than the ties of whoever our current corporate
overlords may be. I'm also a huge UX nerd, and have been known to go "Full Lorax"
to give voice to my users, my peoples.

[Things](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24301)
have been a
[bit](https://sdboyer.io/blog/vgo-and-dep/)
[tense](http://codeengineered.com/blog/2018/golang-godep-to-vgo/)
in the gopher-sphere
[lately](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gopanelIS).
There's a lack of trust,
hurt feelings, and a general sense that we don't have control over Go's direction.

I have learned quite a bit after working on dep for the past year. When the
vgo prototype was released, I dove right in to figure it out. Both have good ideas
baked into them, and _both_ have UX problems that make me twitch. ðŸ˜‰

I am a simple gopher. I'm not great at algorithms, big O-notation, forgot what a
b-tree was 10 minutes after graduation, and am constantly failing [Dave Cheney's
Go pop quizzes](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/pop-quiz).

But I have a super power: I deeply care about keeping
the Go community a place where I am proud to call myself a gopher. As part of Women
Who Go, I encourage everyone I meet to join us, and assure
them that it's a fun, safe space to learn and grow. I have also been known to resort
to sticker bribery. ðŸ˜‡

So instead of comparing dep and the vgo prototype, weighing-in on which team I am
on, here's what I would rather do: I am making a new team and inviting you all to be a part of it.

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Team Gopher</p>

I am going to use my super power, and my experience with dependency
management, to shape the native dependency management capabilities of the Go toolchain
into something that meets the needs of the _entire Go community_. And I'm going to
need your help.

Here are my goals:
* Collaborate on and improve the dependency management that will be built-into the Go toolchain.
* Build a great user experience that doesn't let our fellow gophers down.
* Give library authors the control they need to transparently communicate what works
  with their library, without requiring hacks or manual coordination.
* Ensure the community isn't blocked or otherwise discouraged from innovating on alternate
  dependency managers.

Together we are going to do some fun things:

* Become upstream Go contributors!
* Give feedback on Go as reviewers!
* Make official Go proposals, get them approved and implemented!
* Annoy Google with ðŸ’– ALL ðŸ¦„ THE ðŸŒˆ EMOJI ðŸ˜Ž!
