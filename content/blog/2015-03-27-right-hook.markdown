I was recently invited to join Atlassian Allstars program, which I would love to link to but they don't appear to have a public page so... oops maybe I wasn't supposed to let anyone know about it. <em>First rule of Atlassian Allstars is you don't talk about Atlassian Allstars!</em> In my ongoing quest to earn enough achievment points to be a part of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Atlassian Justice League</span> Atlassian Customer Advisory panel... I took on the [Stash: Beer-o-Clock challenge](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/01/beer-o-clock-stash-plugin-tutorial/).

I decided to create a Stash repository hook that prints out a Chuck Norris quote every time you push. I whipped up the plugin in short order and tweeted a screenshot to claim my achievos.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p>I just built an <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlassian">@atlassian</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stash?src=hash">#stash</a> hook that quotes Chuck Norris with every push: Right Hook <a href="http://t.co/pIxN4mHarn">http://t.co/pIxN4mHarn</a> <a href="http://t.co/2YAj749CkE">http://t.co/2YAj749CkE</a></p>&mdash; Carolyn Van Slyck (@carolynvs) <a href="https://twitter.com/carolynvs/status/581064247330779137">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Who would have guessed that would become my most popular tweet to date? Other than Chuck Norris that is. :-) So by popular demand I give you... **[Right Hook!](/projects/right-hook/)** Install, enjoy and feel free to fork and use for your own evil purposes.
