Clouds kinda suck. Don't get me wrong. I like them because I don't have to beg
someone in IT to provision a database, load balancer, static IP or virtual
machine. However the complexity and knowledge required to deploy software has
really increased over the years and clouds have had a bit to do with it.

I can deploy my code ANYWHERE. Emphasis on _me_ deploying that code, not some
beleaguered ops person, hidden away in the company's "on-premise data center"
*cough* closet *cough*. There are a lot of great tools out there that let
me pretend that I'm doing devops: Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, [insert 500 more
tools here].

Any one of those tools does a pretty good job in their own domain. But I never
have the luxury of learning and dealing with just one of them. I'm always gluing
together my cloud provider's CLI, Kubernetes, Helm, whatever I could find that
is giving me Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, **lots** of awkward glue scripts to
hack together configuration, secret management, persistent storage and jeez I
still haven't even mentioned my own application yet have I? Really that's the
only thing I wanted to deal with in the first place... 🤦‍♀️

### This is the problem that CNAB wants to solve

How do we make it easier to manage _everything_ it takes to install, upgrade,
uninstall and generally operate an application? When I say everything I'm
referring to:

* Tools that you need installed on your laptop or in your production environment
  before you can even begin, like `helm`, `terraform`, `az`, or `kubectl`.
* Helm charts, and yaml files.
* Bash scripts for each environment.
* Various configuration files, parameters and credentials.
* Collections of docker images with knowledge of what volumes need to be
  mounted, environment variables set and commands run when you start them.
* Logic to manage all the infrastructure on which the application runs.

A Cloud Native Application Bundle ([CNAB][cnab]) is something that wraps up all
of this so that someone can install an application on a cloud, from scratch with
nothing else on their machine but porter and docker, with just one command
`porter install myapp`. They didn't need to make a cluster, download kubectl or
helm, figure out the right helm chart, or write any bash to connect it all
together.

The CNAB specification is just enough agreement between a bunch of
big companies to make sure that bundles made by Docker or Pivotal or Microsoft
work with each other's tools. It is concerned with how to execute a bundle,
but not how to author a bundle. **CNAB is about the runtime**.

<p align="center"><em>What problem does Porter solve?</em></p>

### Porter makes authoring bundles easier

* **Pragmatic**<br/>
    Cannot require migrations from existing tools or being the only tool in the
    ecosystem.
* **Composable**<br/>
    Compose bundles using other bundles.
* **Respectful**<br/>
    Respect people's time. Do not require them to know the
    CNAB spec. Must yield a quality, maintainable bundle with low investment of
    time.

It's worth saying that Porter isn't yet another configuration management
tool. It doesn't replace any existing tool out there. If you already have a
bunch of helm charts, terraform configuration files, or even bash
scripts, then that's what you should keep using when you make a bundle.

<p align="center"><em>How does Porter help author bundles?</em></p>

### Free Glue Code

Porter is the glue code to do few things:

* Build a bundle and have it execute an ordered set of tasks.
* Use existing tools in bundles. Porter has **mixins** that adapts these
  tools to CNAB. 
* Connect inputs and outputs between tools that were never made to work
  together, like Helm and the Azure CLI. For example, if your bundle uses Azure
  to create a managed database, and then Helm to deploy Wordpress, Porter
  handles the extracting the database connection string from the Azure mixin and
  injecting it into the Helm mixin.


### Developer Experience

Porter doesn't just make authoring bundles easier. Porter is designed to have
the best developer experience for working with bundles, full stop.

Those that know me, know that I care about the user experience more than shiny
technical solutions. Since I'm the creator, tech lead, project manager and chief
emoji officer of Porter, that means that the GitHub label that carries the most
weight in my repo is `user experience 🌈💖`.

I think that's a problem worth solving too.
