Clouds kinda suck. Don't get me wrong. I like them because I don't have to beg someone
in IT to provision a database, load balancer, static IP or virtual machine.
However the complexity and knowledge required to deploy software has really
increased over the years and clouds have had a bit to do with it.

I can deploy my code ANYWHERE. Emphasis on _me_ deploying that code, not some
beleaguered ops person, hidden away in the company's "on-premise data center"
*cough* closet *cough*. There are a lot of great tools out there that let
me pretend that I'm doing devops: Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, [insert 500 more
tools here].

Any one of those tools does a pretty good job in their own domain. But I never
have the luxury of learning and dealing with just one of them. I'm always gluing
together my cloud provider's CLI, Kubernetes, Helm, whatever I could find that
is giving me Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, **lots** of awkward glue scripts to
hack together configuration, secret management, persistent storage and jeez I
still haven't even mentioned my own application yet have I? Really that's the
only thing I wanted to deal with in the first place... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### This is the problem that CNAB wants to solve

How do we make it easier to manage _everything_ it takes to install, upgrade,
uninstall and generally operate an application? When I say everything I'm
referring to:

* The tools that you need installed on your laptop or in your 
  production environment to even **begin**, like `helm`, `terraform`, `az`, or
  `kubectl`.
* The helm charts, and yaml files.
* The hand crafted bash scripts for each environment.
* The various configuration files, parameters and credentials.
* The collection docker images with knowledge of what volumes need to be
  mounted, environment variables set and commands run when you start them.
* The logic to manage all the infrastructure the application runs on top of.

A Cloud Native Application Bundle ([CNAB][cnab]) is something that wraps up all
of this so that someone can install an application on a cloud, from scratch with
nothing else on their machine but porter and docker, with just one command
`porter install myapp`. They didn't need to make a cluster, download kubectl or
helm, figure out the right helm chart, or write any bash to connect it all
together.

So what problem does Porter solve?

The specification is just enough agreement between a bunch of
big companies to make sure that bundles made by Docker or Pivotal or Microsoft
work with each other's tools. It is concerned with how to execute a bundle,
but not how to author a bundle. **CNAB is about the runtime**.

### Porter makes authoring bundles easier

* **Pragmatic**<br/>
    Cannot require migrations from existing tools or being the only tool in the
    ecosystem.
* **Composable**<br/>
    Compose bundles using other bundles.
* **Respectful**<br/>
    Respect people's time. Do not require them to know the CNAB spec. Must yield a quality, maintainable bundle with low investment of time.

It's worth saying that Porter isn't yet another configuration management
tool. It doesn't replace any existing tool out there. If you already have a
bunch of helm charts, terraform configuration files, or even bash
scripts, then that's what you should keep using when you make a bundle.

So what does Porter help with when you make a bundle?

### Free Glue Code

Porter gives you glue code to do few things:

* Build a bundle and have it execute an ordered set of tasks.
* Use existing tools in bundles. Porter has **mixins** that adapt existing
  tools to CNAB actions, like installing a bundle.
* Connect inputs and outputs between tools that were never made to work together,
  like Helm and the Azure CLI. For example, if your bundle uses Azure to create
  managed database, and then Helm to deploy Wordpress, Porter handles the
  extracting the database connection string from the Azure mixin and injecting it into the Helm mixin.


### Developer Experience

Porter doesn't just make authoring bundles easier. Porter is designed to have the
best developer experience for working with bundles, full stop.

Those that know me, know that I care about the user experience more than technical
solutions. Since I'm the creator, tech lead, project manager and chief emoji officer
of Porter, that means that the GitHub label that carries the most weight in my
repo is `user experience üåàüíñ`.

I think that's a problem worth solving too.√ü
