Last week I wrote down on Michelle Noorali's very official peer review feedback
that is recorded for all time in the Microsoft's HR system

> OMG, I get to work on the same team as my role model!

Ahem. Like an adult. Because I'm an adult.

This is one of the most amazing things about my life right now. I get to not
only meet so many of my role models but I get to move beyond that awkward first
introduction where I realize in real time that I really don't know them at all
beyond the very one-sided view from social media.

That's what really sets up the awkward. I feel like I know this person. I know
all about their Dominoes and ranch dressing preferences (and am 100% on-board).
I have seen more pictures of their dog than my own nephews. Their rants are
spicy, on point and usually fit with my own soapbox.

But now that I've been on the receiving end of a perfect stranger insta-hugging
me in the middle of the street at a conference. Let me say this: you don't know
them and they most certainly don't know you. üòù

### Wrangling the Awkward

Don't lose hope! That doesn't mean you shouldn't say 'hi' to me or someone else
who you happen to know from the internet when you run into them. My trick to
wrangling the awkward is to separate two things:

* What I know about what they have _done professionally_
* What I know about who they _are as a person_

In my experience things get really weird when people make assumptions about the
second bucket. I am always happy to chat about the first. The second is
something that should move just as slowly and naturally as it would in other
situations (read: glacial to tectonic).

So if it's not related to their profession, I suggest not chatting up about it,
even if they did tweet about it the other day. That includes their health,
physical appearance, relationship status, political views, and other little
personal details that may have slipped out when they forgot that they were
tweeting at more than just their immediate friends.

### Awkward Lady Heroes

As I have worked more closely with some of my role models, I am really rethinking
how I give people that label to begin with. It isn't a judgement call about them
as a person, because as we've figured out, I don't know them as a person. It's
simply my way of saying, this person performs actions that I want to mimic and
eventually do at a comparable level.

So working with Michelle, it's not super awkward because I'm not squeeing
internally every 90 seconds, or putting her up on a pedestal as model human being
who is absolutely going to The Good Place. Instead I'm listening to her updates
in standup about how she's tackling a tricky political situation in the CNCF
(which of course _never_ happens), reading her refactoring pull requests because
she explains things well that I find confusing, and inviting her to a design meeting
about structuring cli commands because she just finished an epic PR battle on
the same topic last week in another project.

I think this sometimes gets lost when I hear talk of role models. I don't want
to look up to my role models. I don't know how to interact with someone that I look
up to honestly. But I do know how to learn from someone that is just as awkward as me. üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
