Hi, my name is Carolyn Van Slyck and Microsoft pays me to write open source software. ðŸ‘‹ This _sounds_ super cool and maybe you are wondering how you too can trick a multi-national corporation into paying you to do this too.

From the outside you don't often get a clear view of what it is really like to actually do open source. You see people tweeting memes about geese and KEPs, seemingly having fun and somehow software is getting shipped. Let's get a glimpse into the life of open source, the exciting public parts and the other parts we don't often advertise.

As with any good story, it begins by talking about yourself. Why listen to Carolyn's Very Proper and Goode Advice on Open Source? Because what follows is based on my own 20+ years of experience participating in open source. If you think my oss chops are lacking, then no need to read the rest! Think of the time saved!

One thing that I hope my journey through open source shows is that there is  no one right way to "do open source". On a shallow level, open source is talking about putting code out there with an open-source license, allowing people to not only read the source code, but modify it to suit their own purposes too. There are a lot of different ways to build on top of that.

My first accidental open source contribution was back in the day before WordPress existed. We hadn't yet settled on the one true cms and so I was using something called Geekblog. I had created my own theme for my website, very purple, bubbly and with sparkles and saw other people sharing their themes and figured maybe someone else would like mine too. So I copied what everyone else did, mic dropped it into the Geekblog forum and 

* my open source journey
    * what I have done. these are all based on my 20+ years of experience in open source. it's changed over time
        * geekblog theme
        * custom packages to run svn that worked with the vps software
        * contributing for work projects that we used but wasn't really paid to do
        * atlassian plugins (another vendor's ecosystem sucks)
        * tried to get into .net open source before microsoft became more oss friendly (nuget alternative, .net core early days) this wasn't a good place to be (same as atlassian plugins)
        * contributing to openstack docs
        * always fixing random bugs or adding features in dependencies
        * open source corporate software (carina, rackspace.net)
        * ground floor of dep as a volunteer
        * kubernetes service catalog (worked up to chair then stepped down)
        * porter -> cncf -> maybe it's going to work out?
        * TAG contributor strategy. contributor -> wg lead -> tech lead
        * my own random libraries
    * Why did I decide to do open source as a job?
        * I really like the mix of activities
        * I meet great people and can keep working with them when I change jobs
        * I've always enjoyed it
        * I like contributing to something used by lots of people.
        * lots of opportunities to help other people: mentoring, giving them experience and a space to learn.
    * people ask me for advice and I am constantly having interactions with people that reinforce that most people don't know what to expect out of oss or how to navigate it. (explain the series)
