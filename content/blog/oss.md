* my open source journey
    * what I have done. these are all based on my 20+ years of experience in open source. it's changed over time
        * geekblog theme
        * custom packages to run svn that worked with the vps software
        * contributing for work projects that we used but wasn't really paid to do
        * atlassian plugins (another vendor's ecosystem sucks)
        * tried to get into .net open source before microsoft became more oss friendly (nuget alternative, .net core early days) this wasn't a good place to be (same as atlassian plugins)
        * contributing to openstack docs
        * always fixing random bugs or adding features in dependencies
        * open source corporate software (carina, rackspace.net)
        * ground floor of dep as a volunteer
        * kubernetes service catalog (worked up to chair then stepped down)
        * porter -> cncf -> maybe it's going to work out?
        * TAG contributor strategy. contributor -> wg lead -> tech lead
        * my own random libraries
    * Why did I decide to do open source as a job?
        * I really like the mix of activities
        * I meet great people and can keep working with them when I change jobs
        * I've always enjoyed it
        * I like contributing to something used by lots of people.
        * lots of opportunities to help other people: mentoring, giving them experience and a space to learn.
    * people ask me for advice and I am constantly having interactions with people that reinforce that most people don't know what to expect out of oss or how to navigate it. (explain the series)
* why would I contribute to open source?
    * moving up from toy programs to side projects to production software
    * cheers theme song - name recognition
    * proving yourself a little less often
    * is this ... networking?
    * portfolio
    * Does it actually help with interviews?
    * So why doesn't everyone do it?
        * collaboration is hard
        * working for free
        * rewards are concentrated at the higher commitment level
        * opportunity (ground level of a project)
        * being visible on the internet means exposure to more assholes on the internet
    * How do I get started? (next post)
* new contributor
    * you are always a new contributor
    * what does new contributors welcome mean? 
    * goals (previous blog post)
    * what is a maintainer looking for?
    * how much help can I expect?
        * helping with writing a test
        * helping with dev env setu specific to their project, or running tests
        * their process
        * less okay
            * 101 level programming topics
            * language basics
            * you've never used the project
            * you don't know git (links to where to learn)
            * people will help with minor git stuff but sometimes it gets involved. Knowing how to do the basics is important
            * boils down to people are more willing to help with specific questions than general knowledge. Maintainers aren't here to teach, they are running a project and your contributions should help and not be a net loss of productivity.
            * some projects do offer extra help. those are great if you are new and know you need more help or want mentorship.
    * how do I go from clueless to helpful?
        * commit to self guided learning
        * learn the project!
        * help other people (actually help, if you don't know either or are just pulling in other people that's not very helpful)
        * use the project!
        * read the docs! -> improve the docs!
    * what are the roles in a project?
    * what's it like to contribute?
        * finding a project
        * lurking
        * first contribution
        * is talking to people contributing?
        * hey! I'm a regular this is fun
    * identifying when you aren't ready or a good fit for a project and how to get there
        * small projects without formal mentorship programs, new contributor assistance or contributor ladders
        * you are new to the technology and need lots of external help. perhaps new to both programming and the language used by the project. it's easier to contribute when you are only learning 1-2 new things instead of everything being new (language, programming, github, git, open source, general communication skills)
        * projects where you are familiar with at least one aspect (the language, the domain, the project)
        * build experience with the project first, help  in other ways until you can contribute with more realistic levels of assistance
    * how do I get batter at this? (next post)
* That was awkward, is it always this way?
    * How do I get better?
    * expectations - i.e. this blog post series
    * common traits of successful people
    * it's easier once you know people, not working with strangers
    * get involved with the community
    * communication skills ( separate blog post )
        * really think about where the people that you are working with are coming from. in a job, your goals and circumstances are well-aligned. You are all paid to be there, do this, agree on priority, have common goals, and have the time to do it.
        * often people don't explain all the context behind every comment they make. they will ask for solutions without explaining the background. they assume a level of engagement that matches their own. they take things personally. they don't really understand what motivates and is the priority of the other person. The more you know the smoother these things go.
        * fall back on: clear expectations, asking questions that don't make assumptions about the answer and providing space to let a conversation go where you may not have expected.
    * understand your own boundaries
        * self respect,
        * code of conduct
        * time constraints
        * what you want to get out of this, and when you aren't getting that, i.e. when to disengage
    * disengaging (oops I have taken on too much)
    * scaling (there is only one of you and a lot of people on the internet)
* What is it like being an open source maintainer?
    * hall monitor
    * suddenly you have responsibilities and concerns that most people aren't thinking about (hint they are only thinking about themselves)
    * more roles than you may have wanted: website, organizing people and meetings, communicating roadmaps, new features, breaking changes, social media, help desk, project manager, technical writer.
    * paid to be a maintainer vs free time maintainer
        * juggling work priorities vs what's best for the project
        * both have time boxes, just different ones
        * being paid makes it easier to set it aside, and not let it leak into the rest of your day (maybe)
    * it's a commitment that doesn't have much respect for your varying availability to work on the project
        * I've gotten sick before and had people pestering me. Suddenly you are feeling obligated to share more than  you want.
        * at work you can be out of office and your manager or team will step in for you, or at least understand that you are out. people on teh internet don't know that you are out and their attempts to contact you will incur guilt.
    * why would I want to be one?
        * _controooooool_
        * you need the project
        * you have strong feels about the project and needs that won't be met without contributing
        * you enjoy these tasks
        * you wrote the project (oops)
        * solid experience - but are other ways to get it without the long term committment
    * how do I become a maintainer? Should I want to be one?
        * trust
        * commitment
* What is it like being a project lead/chair?
    * a lot are paid
    * PM job: run meetings, delegate, shepherd work forward, conflict resolution, represent the project, decision maker but not always the technical last say so. 
    * maintainer vs lead/chair
* how do I become a better maintainer?
    * goals: grow the project, step back, carve out time for yourself, improve the project beyond your skills
    * see how to get better at oss communications
    * there is more to do as a maintainer than you can do at once (steal picture of maintainer focus web)
    * more maintainers can increase what you can focus on at once
    * set expectations. regardless of the focus, this matters.
    * admit when you need to improve your skills. Read about being a manager. Attend write the docs. Read up on how to market a project. You won't learn this in one blog post.
    * Pick one focus at a time.
    * understand how much you are interested in committing to the project and draw boundaries.
        * anticipate that your availability will happen (sick days, pto, life) and prepare for it. Use github statuses. log out of slack and turn off email notifications, deputize someone else to handle fires if possible. Set clear boundaries and take care of yourself first.
        * it helps to acknowledge that you have more energy sometimes and take on too much, then are stuck with the bill later.
    * process can help -> or it can get in the way. Depends on where you are in your growth.
        * Some process helps others: contributing guide, explain project governance / ladder potential.
        * Save others for when you need to coordinate people
    * Pay attention to what will help you with your goals now. Some things feel necessary but may not be right for your project because you are in the wrong phase of growth, aren't paid to do this, or it just doesn't help you.
    * Do things that scale you out, reduce unhappy interactions, make you want to work on the project more, don't chew up your maintainers, avoid driving away strong contributors. 
    * Admit when you just want it to be your project and be clear about it. Not everything needs a community.
    * When would you walk away and how?
* Do I want oss to be my job?
    * scarce, hard to get, not as many places to hop around
    * much lower velocity
    * rarely working with people aligned with you. see convincing strangers to review your code.
    * lots of context switching because of bottlenecks
    * all the benefits of oss, but at a level where you really can see the rewards
    * may not want to do any of this in your free time anymore. could be good or bad.
    * people will want things from you that press that work/not work boundary
    * it's awkward to make a commitment to a project and then have work not back you up or change their mind
    * uses a lot of different skill sets that you may not be ready/interested in doing a bunch at work
* Resources:
    * kubernetes contributor experience
    * cncf tag contributor strategy
    * oss books?
    * tweeps to follow
    * conference talks (gopherpalooza)
