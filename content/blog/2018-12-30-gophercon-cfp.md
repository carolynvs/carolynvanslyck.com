I want to encourage you to [submit a talk to GopherCon](https://www.papercall.io/gophercon-2019).
You. Yes you, hiding
behind the potted plant. If you are afraid of public speaking, I am not the type
of person to convince you otherwise. But if what's holding you back is worry that
you are not an expert, or that you don't know what to talk about, or how to get your
talk accepted, I would like to help.

Before 2016, I had never given a public talk. When I had to speak in front of my
team during scrum or during tech lunches, I felt like I was going to hurl. Then
I got a new manager, and she either was really excited about my lack of public
speaking skills, or forgot that I was a developer instead of a developer advocate.
She gave me a goal of giving 4-6 talks that year. _gulp_

So of course, instead of
having an awkward conversation to clear up the confusion, I just decided it was
easier to speak at conferences. &lt;END OF MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH&gt;

I often serve on program committees for conferences to help select talks. In fact,
I'm on the program committee again this year for GopherCon San Diego! I really would
like to see more new faces up on stage this year and thought that I could use the
magic of the internet to trick y'all into submitting a talk.

## Stories, Not Experts

I am usually bored by talks given by "experts".
I much prefer hearing stories from someone like me who may be learning as they go,
laugh along at their mistakes, get a peek into the types of problems that they are
solving, and follow their journey from problem, to potential solutions, hearing
how nothing went as planned, and learning from their experiences.

On the flip side, make sure that you are speaking about something that _you already
know_. Don't learn something just in time for the conference. That is stressful
and probably won't go over well.

##### You do not need to be an "expert" to speak at a conference

## Beyond Blog Posts

When I'm reviewing potential talks, I try to keep an eye out for what would be
entertaining to listen to live, vs. what would have worked just fine as a reference
blog post. For example, a perfectly fine blog post may focus on "How to do X", while
a great talk may dive into "Why I thought I needed to solve X but ended up doing Y"
or bringing a difficult topic to life like Kavya's wonderful talks on how [channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBZlN0izeiY)
or the [scheduler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHRO5WQGh0k) works under the hood.
If I had stumbled upon blog posts explaining those topics, I would have noped
out after 15 seconds, overwhelmed, but with Kavya explaining it, it was easy to follow along.

##### Focus on details that are fun to listen to in person

## No Surprises

As a reviewer, I am responsible for the attendees getting their monies worth,
preserving the conference's reputation and respecting everyone's time. I can't do
that with a talk proposal that doesn't give me enough information to know what they
will talk about. Not just the topic, and the main points, but _details_. I need to know
the best practices that they will recommend, the libraries they are going to tell
people to use, the myths they are debunking, etc.

The CFP gives you a text box to put in top secret notes that only the reviewers can see.
**USE IT**.

Tell me everything. Give me an outline. Link to code gists and blog posts.
Do whatever you can to make it clear to me that you are going to use your speaking
slot for good.

##### Tell the reviewers everything that you will talk about

## Seriously, No Surprises

You know who also doesn't like surprises? Attendees. They are often picking which
talk to go to minutes before it starts. Make it easy for them to pick your talk.

Cute titles may be cute, but they don't help people know what your talk will be about.
In your abstract, don't tease or hint. Make it clear what people will learn
or come away with.

##### Make is easy for attendees to want to come to your talk

## My Process

Everyone comes up with talk ideas differently and I don't have suggestions for
that part. However, once I do I have an idea, this is my process for turning that
idea into a proposal:

1. Write down a bulleted list of everything that I could say about it.
1. Add nested details on anything that is interesting to me.
1. Look it over and decide if I have 3-5 points. If not, I may not have enough
  content for a talk. Sometimes I have more than one talk!
1. Star those points and think about how they all fit together. Is there a theme? Often
  I can spin the same points a few different ways depending on the conference.
1. Consider what people would find interesting about these items. What's the problem that they are all related to? What can people learn from it?
1. Identify the story. All of my talks usually have a story line holding the entire
  talk together to make it engaging, and honestly because it just fits into my
  speaking style. If there isn't a story, I don't bother making it into a talk.
1. Write an abstract.
1. Write a title.
1. Write a bio for the conference. I usually customize my bio for each conference,
  sometimes even per talk if I submit more than once, to highlight different parts of
  my background.
1. Submit variations of the talk to multiple conferences.

I keep most of my talk proposals in a [repository](https://github.com/carolynvs/cfp/tree/master/cfp).
Feel free to take a peek to see
just how rough they look, and what a proposal could look like. Not all have
been accepted.

Even if you just put it in a gist, having something that you can link to other people
makes it easier to ask for feedback. I will often ask people on slack in gophers,
and womenwhogo to take a look before submitting.
