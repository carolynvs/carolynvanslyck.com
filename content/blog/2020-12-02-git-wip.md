Have you ever run `git branch` and still wasn't sure what each one is for and if
it's recent? Here's a useful git alias, `git wip` that displays the name of the
branches and when you last changed it. It's really useful for remembering which
one you were just working on, and which branches probably should be deleted.

Edit your `~/.gitconfig` file (or create one if you don't have it) and add the
following lines. If you already have an alias section, add this to the existing
section:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/carolynvs/c9357f45b6230cc8c3b302e83e3961a0.js"></script>

The branches are sorted in descending order so that you will see the most recent
branches at the bottom. Just in case you have so many that the output scrolls,
you can still see the most recent branches. Not that I would ever have so many
old branches lying around or anything that I'd need that... ðŸ˜‡
