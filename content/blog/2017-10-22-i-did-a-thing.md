So I haven't been completely honest with you. I left some parts out of my story.
This isn't just about video transcoding, Kubernetes, or rainbow-colored
ponies.

In March, after a rousing breakfast at the local pancake house, I realized what
I really wanted to do next in my career: I wanted to work with Go, interact with the community,
and contribute to upstream Kubernetes... for my day job. I wanted to build the next generation cloud infrastructure
that I had fallen in love with over the past year. I wanted
to be a part of something that, when I met you at the next meetup or conference,
I could cajole you into trying out for the first time.

I picked up those little computers with the vague intention of building out a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster
because I thought I could learn a lot from doing it. And because this bear is fucking inspirational.

*I would totes hang with this bear*

It was a really great plan with absolutely nothing behind it. I knew Go, I knew enough
of Kubernetes to be really excited about it, but I wasn't able to convince
anyone to take a chance on me.

I spent months quietly agonizing over if I had made a huge mistake, all
the while continuing to double down on my big plan. I pushed so many pull requests
to [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) that Sam broke down and promoted me to a maintainer.
I attended GopherCon in July and had a great time hacking
with people I had previously only known by their github handles.

And then this happened: I was too lazy to get off the couch to put in a DVD, and yet
fanciful enough to think spending three months building a pony-themed cluster was less work.

But that's not the end of my story. While I did battle with my pony cluster,
I kept applying to my list of dream jobs. _"Not technical enough", "Not a Linux kernel developer",
"Not enough production distributed systems experience", "Not an SRE"_...
After months of rejection, it became more and more difficult not to believe that the problem really was me...

Eventually I had applied to every company on my list but one. I was damned afraid
of applying because when they inevitably passed on me like everyone else had,
my list would be empty, and then what would I do? Fuck if I was going to admit that my big dream was a big bust,
that there wasn't room for someone like me. So I pestered everyone I knew at this company,
no matter how tenuous the connection, until I finally heard back and landed a phone screen.

And you know what? This time it wasn't a dramatic reenactment of the Spanish Inquisition. We just
talked about the things I loved, until he really had to go. They called me in for an on-site
interview, and this time no one questioned whether I belonged in that interview. We all talked shop,
I babbled about the latest k8's release, my little pony cluster, and of course tried to trick people
into using dep.

As luck would have it, my story has **two** happy endings.
I am joining the Microsoft Azure Containers team next month!
Thanks to my husband buying me
time by working for The Man, the amazing support from my fellow gophers, and maybe a little bit of help from a little pony cluster...
I did it.
