This is the story of how I went from chipping away at archiving my movie collection one DVD
at at time to running a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster capable of transcoding dozens a day.

One night a few months back, my husband decided to stream a movie on Netflix,
something that we already owned on DVD because getting off the couch to put the DVD in the player is hard.
Silly? You bet! Until I remembered that Comcast has recently imposed a 1TB monthly bandwidth cap on our account, and then it felt a whole lot more silly. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Suddenly I was a women on a mission:
to save all my DVDs so that I could watch them without getting off the couch.
A most honorable honorable quest indeed.

It took me quite a few weekends, but
I finally did it! ‚ù§Ô∏è I am now the proud owner of the My Little Pony<sup>TM</sup> cluster pictured below.
It can can simultaneously transcode five HD videos in three hours. In case of a power outage,
not an uncommon occurrence around here, everything will reboot and pick up where they left off without a hiccup.
If I get a little crazy and buy a few more nodes, they can go from assembled to "work horses" in about 7 minutes.

*We're gonna need some more horsepower!*

It goes without saying that a pony-powered cluster is a gift unto itself.
But for me, getting there, _finishing a side-project_, was the best part.
I'm going to skip over my exact steps at times; this isn't a howto.
Each step in the story serves a purpose though. If I only showed you the final working setup,
you may be tricked into believing that said magical setup had sprung fully-formed
from my brainbox, and that is very much NOT the case.

*I am not cool enough to do this*

I worked
on this in fits and starts, with long periods in-between where I did other things
like contribute to OSS, be with my family, binge on Netflix, and post pictures of my cats
on Instagram. If I was ever going to finish, I needed to change only one thing at a time,
ideally completing each piece by the end of the weekend. That way whenever I found more
time to work on my project, the only thing I needed to do was identify the next step.
I never wanted to be stuck figuring out a chain of "wip: still borked" commits, two stashes,
and a handful of uncommitted changes that I didn't remember making three weeks ago.
