I don't know how to put this politely but the command-line experience on Windows sucks*.
If you are using the default terminal in Windows, whether with CMD, PowerShell or Bash,
you may not realize it but you are dying a death from a thousand cuts.
In this tutorial, you will setup an alternative terminal that supports
fun stuff: window resizing, tabs, intuitive copy/paste and pretty colors.

\* <span style="font-size: .8em">Yes, I am aware that the [terminal in Windows 10 has a lot of improvements][win10-terminal].
But I'm still not using it because a) I'm avoiding Windows 10 until I am forced to upgrade
and b) the alternative terminals as still nicer, with more features.</span>

Before we start, let's get some definitions out of the way: the term _shell_ refers to a
command-line interpreter that executes text commands (such as CMD, PowerShell or Bash) and _terminal_ is the
graphical window that hosts a shell.

For years I have used ConsoleZ, and it is still something that I would recommend
as I find it to be one of the easiest terminals to configure. However, today
I want to demonstrate how to setup ConEmu. It supports all the same features as
ConsoleZ and while it may be a bit more complex to setup, it is also much more powerful
and [documented to boot][doc].

[doc]: http://conemu.github.io/en/TableOfContents.html

1. Install ConEmu
    * If you have [Chocolatey][choco], run `choco install conemu`.
    * Otherwise [download the installer][download] and run it, accepting all defaults.
2. Run ConEmu by selecting "ConEmu" from the Start Menu.

[choco]: http://chocolatey.org

Congratulations, you now have a civilized terminal installed and ready to use!
You could just stop right here and call it a day. I wouldn't blame you. Take it for
and spin and you'll see that you can resize the window, select text with your mouse to
copy it, and `CTRL+V` will paste. Huzzah!

However, a little bit of configuration is worth the effort. Below are some tweaks
that I find useful make sure to read the  to learn about all
the bells and whistles.

## Initial Configuration
When you first start ConEmu, an [initial configuration prompt][fast-setup] is displayed.
It is safe to accept the defaults, but here are a few suggested changes:

* Select a default shell, e.g. CMD, Bash or PowerShell.
* Choose a color scheme, my favorite is [Monokai][monokai].
* Opt-in to automatic updates for stable releases.

## Replace Default Terminal
This is ConEmu's killer feature. It is so frustrating to setup a sexy terminal,
just the way you like it, then be sent back to the dark ages when another process
pops up a terminal.

1. Open ConEmu.
2. Go to `Settings > Integration > Default term`.
3. Check "Force ConEmu as default terminal" and "Register on OS Startup".

VoilÃ ! Now when Visual Studio pops open a terminal, you are rewarded
with ConEmu, instead of the stinky old Windows command prompt.

## Tweaking Paste
The default keybindings for paste are interesting but not what I expected out of the box.
`CTRL+V` will only paste the first line in your clipboard. `SHIFT+INS` will paste
the entire contents of your clipboard (including newlines). It also prompts you
if pasting new lines.

I prefer that `CTRL+V` pastes everything and doesn't give me any guff about it.
See the screenshot below for where to find the hotkeys.

* Map `CTRL+V` to paste everything. `Settings > Keys and Macro > User CTRL+V`
* Unmap paste first line. `Settings > Keys and Macro > User SHIFT+INS`
* Disable the newline warning. `Settings > Keys and Macro > Paste > Confirm <ENTER> keypress`

## Other Shells
By default ConEmu starts up with the CMD shell. Once it is open, you could type
`powersehll`, `python` or `bash.exe --login` to use another shell.
However there is an easier way: [Tasks][task-doc]. Tasks are quite powerful. Not only
can they start up new tabs with a different shell, but they can be used to run
saved commands in the current session.

ConEmu comes with some predefined tasks, like starting an Administrator PowerShell session.
It can even detect your own setup and suggest some additional tasks. Since [I have have lolnix][stealth-lolnix], it automatically added a task to start up Bash for me.
To detect and add additional tasks, go to `Settings > Startup > Tasks` and click the "Add default tasks..." button.

The [tutorial for adding a new task][new-task] walks you through adding a task to start the Visual Studio Command Prompt,
which I find very useful.

## Making things pretty
This is purely aesthetics. Here is what you need to change if you want to match
my screenshots:

* Use the monokai scheme. `Settings > Features > Colors > Scheme`
* Use the consolas font, size 16 pt. `Settings > Main`
* Hide the search bar. `Settings > Appearance > Show search field in tab bar`
* Hide the status bar. `Settings > Features > Status bar > Show the status bar`

# Next Steps
Congratulations, you are now more productive with the command line than 99% of
your Windows brethren. But don't stop now, there's more fun stuff you can do
now that you have a proper terminal:

* [Install a Linux-like Environment on Your Windows Machine in Minutes][stealth-lolnix]
* Save Keystrokes by Customizing your Bash Configuration _coming soon!_
