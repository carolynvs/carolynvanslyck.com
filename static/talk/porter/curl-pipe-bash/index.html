					<h2>Why we secretly like curl | bash</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Instant gratification</li>
						<li class="fragment">No experience required</li>
						<li class="fragment">High likelihood of success</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						* Why we secretly like curl | bash (1m)
						* It is a one-liner to install.
						* Requires little to no knowledge of the installation logic or tooling.
						* We believe that the project maintainers can automate the installation better than us on the first try.

					<h2>Would you give an internet rando root on your machine?</h2> 
					<h2 class="fragment">Oops, you just did...</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						The script can do anything you can.
						You may think it will just install the app but you just gave it access to:
						* env variables and files with tokens and passwords
						* full control over your filesystem
						* full access to your network and connected devices
						* impersonating you

						* still running as you

					<h2>Okay now make it cloud native</h2>

					picture reading the docs, then blocks of tools, tableflip
					<aside class="notes">
You know who could really benefit from a one-liner? Cloud Native Deployments
    * Most of us don't want to read a series of docs, and install extra tools to try something out.
    * Next we have to figure out how to script coordinating these tools. For example, creating a database, and then passing the connection string as a helm chart value.
    * Lots of people stop there and decide it is more work than they are willing to invest. Especially initially when they don't know if they want to use the software.
					</aside>

				<section id="porter">
					<h2>Let's make those one-liners safe!</h2>

					porter logo

					<p>Package your application artifact, client tools, configuration and deployment logic together as a versioned bundle that you can distribute, and then install with a single command</p>
					<aside class="notes">
    * Flip the reflexive "You can't do that, it's not safe" to "How can we make it safe?"
    * Porter is one way have a safer one-line installer.
    * With bundles, a project can release not only its artifacts and install docs, but also a bundle that includes real-world deployment logic to deploy the application to the cloud.
    * Bundles provide a way to understand what is inside that package and safely execute it.

				<section id="ship-logic">
					<h2>Ship your deployment logic</h2>

					<p>You release artifacts, installation docs, why not the deployment logic?</p>

					<h2>Bundles can explain themselves</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Credentials</li>
						<li class="fragment">Parameters</li>
						<li class="fragment">Components Used</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						* what secrets it will use, it can only access what you give it
						* how you can customize the installation
						* does it use arbitrary bash scripts? just helm and kubectl?
						* doesn't run on the host, brings its own tooling
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="the-app">
					<h2>Let's install something!</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Runs on Kubernetes</li>
						<li>Installed with Helm</li>
						<li>Connected to a cloud database</li>
						<li>Fronted by CloudFlare</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
    * Explain that a bundle can work with any tool. 
	* It could have just as easily been serverless functions, virtual machines, etc.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="write-it">
					<h2>Create our bundle</h2>

					cut to recorded demo that looks at the bundle
					show porter.yaml using mixins
					call out that mixins pass data

					<aside class="notes">
						This is what you ship
    * Emphasis on how to transform that mega bash script that gets piped to bash into something that exposes more metadata and is parameterized.
    * Show how Porter Mixins chain together the other tools and existing scripts. Contrast what is deployed with our bundle to what our bash installation script was deploying. Namely, an entire working deployment instead of just the application itself.
					</aside>

				<section id="publish-it">
					<h2>Distribute our bundle</h2>

					demo build and publish
				</section>

				<section id="install-it">
					<h2></h2>

					show porter explain output for our bundle

					call out the credentials it needs
					run credentials generate and point to a keyvault instance
					run install
					
					<aside class="notes">
						explain that now we are a user and we want to install it
					</aside>

				<section id="use-cases">
					<h2>Who would use this?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Quickstarts - Do I want to use this?</li>
						<li class="fragment">Customer Installations - Do they want to manage this?</li>
						<li class="fragment">Your Own Deployments - Hey I didn't write this!</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
* Winning over potential adopters
* Customers have to install and manage your software, what can you provide beyond docs to make them more successful?
* At your own company, the people who know how to install and manage the software aren't the ones tasked with doing so.
