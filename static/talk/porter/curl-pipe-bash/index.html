						Hi, I'm Carolyn Van Slyck a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft.
						Today I wanted to think through how we can have our cake and eat it too.
						Namely I love curl | bash for its simplicity, and a lot of cloud native software
						could benefit from having a more straightforward installation. But common wisdom 
						says that curling a script and piping it to bash isn't safe. But what if it could be?

				<section id="problem-statement">
					<h2>curl https://example.com/install-it-quick.sh | bash</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						First let's talk about what "curl | bash" is. That's when you copy/paste 
						a command that looks like the one here. We all use scripts like this because
						they quickly install software that you aren't familiar with.
						curl downloads the script, and then the script contents are "piped" to bash
						where they are immediately executed.

					<h2>Why we secretly like curl | bash</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Instant gratification</li>
						<li class="fragment">No experience required</li>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Personally I really like installation scripts because:
						* It is a one-liner to install.
						* Requires little to no knowledge of the installation logic or tooling.
						* We believe that the project maintainers can automate the installation better than us on the first try.

						Let's review though why using curl pipe bash is a security risk.

					<h2>Would you give an internet rando <span class="blue">root</span> on your laptop?</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						Let's say someone on the internet offered to help install something for you real quick.
						All you need to do is hand over your laptop for 5 seconds. I don't know about you, 
						but I don't hand over my laptop to my husband and I _trust him_. Mostly. ÔøΩÔøΩ

						When we think about handing over your laptop to a stranger, its easy to see why its risky.
						They would have access to everything on there: your documents, pictures, environment variables
						containing security tokens and passwords, you're logged into a bunch of sites, maybe even your
						work VPN. It's clear that stranger could do anything with your laptop that you yourself could do.

						That doesn't change when you switch from a physical laptop to a quick copy/paste of an installation 
						script. Oops.

						Okay, so what if you read the script first and then run it? Just open the
						script in your browser, look it over and go "yeah this looks like how I expected"
						and then copy/paste that one liner.

						Here's a fun fact: a web server can detect that you are piping that web request
						to bash. I'll provide a link later with the details but a malicious server could
						detect that you are piping to bash and then decide to give you a different file.
						Not that file that you just read in your browser, but whatever it wants. And
						then you are right back to where you started. Letting randos run amok on your computer.

					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						Instead of using that handy one liner, here's a safer way to run an installation script:
						1. First, download the script.
						2. Then if they provided a checksum of the script, compare the checksum of the file you
						just downloaded against it and ensure that they match.
						3. Ok, _now_ you can read the downloaded script. Scan that lovely bash and nod your head 
						like you totes get what it's doing.
						4. Finally, you can run the script.

						Like... that works but eh, I personally find it annoying.
						1. The copy/paste -> success experience from the one liner is lost.
						2. No one really wants to read bash, and depending on the complexity of the script
						even after reading it you may not be completely sure what it's going to do.
						3. Most importantly, when you do finally run the script, it's executing as your user.
						So if you did miss something when slogging through that bash? oops.

					<h2>But what if I really want to?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Reading is hard ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</li>
						<li>Cloud Native deployments can be pretty complex</li>
						<li>I want it to be easier for people to try out my project</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Alright so we aren't supposed to curl pipe bash but... What if I really want to anyway?
						Have you ever wanted to try out some software, and the installation instructions are like
						15 steps where you have to install 3 CLIs, copy your credentials yet again into more environment variables
						that you will forget about and leave around forever, and it requires a database that you
						don't feel like figuring out how to setup, and really now that you think about it, maybe 
						you'll just try this out some other time because this is just one more yak to shave and you
						have work to do.

						You know who could really benefit from a one-liner? Cloud Native Deployments 
						Often they are complex, with dependencies, dedicated CLIs,
						magic configuration, credentials... Most of us don't want to read a series of docs, 
						and install extra tools to try something out. We _really_ don't want to figure out how to 
						script coordinating these tools. For example, creating a database, and then passing the 
						connection string as a helm chart value. 
						
						Lots of potential users stop there and decide it is more work than they are willing to invest. 
						Especially when they are figuring out which software they want to use, and they are installing a
						couple and trying them out to see how they work.

						So I know that I just said that we shouldn't curl pipe bash, but if we could
						just provide our users a great experience to quickly setup and try out our software, that
						would be great, right?

					<aside class="notes">
						So let's flip the reflexive "You can't do that, it's not safe" to "How can we make it safe?"
						What would we need to do that?
						* We need to isolate the installer, only giving access to what it needs, instead
						of being able to read god knows what that is hiding on my laptop.
						* Ideally we also want something that does the boring stuff like checking signatures or digests
						for us.
						* The icing would be if it could provide reliable insight into what is actually in 
						the installer so that they don't have to read the source.

						There are a couple tools out there that can meet most of our requirements, one of which 
						is the CNCF sandbox project, Porter. Let's see how close we can get to making a safer

				<section id="demo">
					<h2>Demo: Use a bundle</h2>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Now let's use Porter to install Tabby Tracker _safely_. No curl pipe bash for us!
						
						First, I will use porter explain to learn how to install the bundle. Bundles
						have metadata that describes what the bundle is, its version, the credentials
						it needs to install, any parameters that you can use to customize the installation,
						its dependencies (bundles can rely on other bundles and porter will handle installing that for you),
						and also any custom actions defined. All bundles have install, upgrade and uninstall but you
						could define extra actions like status, or database dumps/backups, any extra operational logic that
						someone would find useful when managing an installation of your app.

						Looking over my bundle, I see that I'll need an Azure service principal,
						and I can pick which region to use. Looks like the bundle will use
						terraform to create a Kubernetes cluster and a database, and then it will
						install the app with Helm. When it's done the bundle will output the kubeconfig
						for the cluster, and a connection string for the database.

						That seems legit. Next, I'm going to tell Porter where it can lookup any credentials
						that the bundle needs, in this case an Azure service principal. Instead of storing
						them in environment variables on my computer, I'm going to put them into a secret store.
						Here I have Azure KeyVault setup with secrets for the service principal. I'm using Azure here but
						I could have used any secret store, like Hashicorp Vault.
						
						I'm going to create a "credential set" in porter, that is a mapping between the credentials used by the bundle,
						and where porter can locate those credentials. I'll run porter credentials generate, and
						give it my bundle. Porter will walk me through each credential and where its stored.

						This is an extra step for installing something that you wouldn't have to do with curl pipe bash.
						Remember that one of our goals was isolating the installation script from our local computer?
						It shouldn't be able to just snoop around and find juicy environment variables hiding my cloud credentials.
						When Porter runs a bundle, the bundle executes inside a docker container. Any credentials that the bundle
						needs, must be explicitly passed in. A credential set lets me store a hint for porter on how to find
						my credentials, maybe I have one for my azure credentials, another for aws, or github. I can define it
						once and then when I run a bundle that needs access, I can give the bundle that credential set without
						having to respecify each time how to read them out of a secret store.

						Now that all this security stuff is out of the way, here's the "one-liner" to replace our curl pipe bash.
						I can run porter install, give it my credentials, and the bundle to install and that's it. Even though
						the bundle is using helm and terraform, I don't have to have that installed on my machine, because the bundle,
						a docker container, has the right versions of each CLI installed inside along with my terraform files, and Helm
						charts. Everything my app needs to install is inside that bundle. It doesn't matter what I'm installing,
						it's just the same porter install command.

						Cool, now that my app is installed, let's check it out. As you can see I am still an _aspiring_ web designer 
						but hopefully all my saved tabby cats makes up for my horrible CSS skills.

				<section id="write-it">
					<h2>Demo: Make a bundle</h2>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's see what it takes to create a bundle.

						A bundle is defined by a porter.yaml file. This manifest contains
						not just the metadata about the bundle, like here you can see
						that I've declared that TabbyCats Tracker needs an Azure service principal,
						and has a region parameter.

						Keep going and it also declares what tools are inside the bundle by declaring
						"mixins". Mixins are building blocks for bundles and help you use existing tools
						like terraform and helm here, inside a bundle and have it work the way you'd expect.
						Mixins install the tools inside the bundle's docker image, and map between the yaml
						you see here, and the final CLI commands executed.

						Mixins can make it easier to write the bundle, for example since we are using helm
						inside of the install action, it will automatically call helm install. They also help
						you extract data from a step and pass it into the next step in your installation.

						Here my terraform module created a cluster and database, and I'm grabbing those
						out of that step and making them available to the helm chart that is run next.

						Normally this type of stuff is all done with a bit of glue bash, and the mixins
						make it easier to focus on the logic for your installation.

						The porter explain command that we ran earlier, uses all the metadata in this file
						to generate an explanation of what the bundle is, what tools it is using and the credentials
						that the bundle needs.

						So did we hit the mark? If I'm looking for a safer way to quickly install

					<aside class="notes">
						Bundles really just borrow security features from existing tools.
						We can check off "isolated installer", they run in a container and
						only have access to what we explicitly provide, like some cloud credentials.
						They are distributed over OCI (or docker) registries. This is existing infrastructure
						that we already know how to run, can scan for vulerabilities, check digests (which Porter does for you),
						and we are working on being able to sign bundles with Notary so that Porter can even check

					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Great, so it's safer than curl | bash but is the experience what we were aiming for?
						It isn't always a one-liner. The first time you run a new bundle, you're going to run 
						porter explain to see what credentials it needs, and then create a credential set with 
						the credentials it needs if you don't have one already. But for bundles that you have
						worked with before, it is just porter install. I'm calling it close enough.

						It's always the same command, just porter install, regardless of the tech stack tucked
						away inside the bundle. So we are doing good there.

						And finally, what we really wanted all along was a magic installer. Someone with no experience
						with the application or its deployment tools can run install and get a working installation 
						in no time. So yup! you can use Porter as a safer curl | bash for cloud native deployments.

						Mission accomplished!

				<section id="use-cases">
					<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Who would use this?</h2>

					<img src="images/use-cases.png"/>

					<aside class="notes">
						So I said that this is a safer curl pipe bash _for the cloud_. It's not really intended
						to install a CLI on your local machine for example. What bundles can help make safer and
						easier would be:

						* QuickStarts! Help someone get your software setup for them to try out.
						
						* Customer Installations: In addition to writing an installation guide, you can
						also give them an installer, that not only helps them install it the first time,
						but track upgrades over time, and manage any other operational concerns, like status
						troubleshooting or backups.
						
						* Your Own Applications: Just like an external customer would appeciate a little help
						setting up and running your software, the same applies to people on your team. The people who
						manage your software in production aren't always the developers who wrote it. Being able
						to upgrade to a patch version, or quickly flip a parameter to crank up the log level to 11,
						with a single command is just plain useful. A team can share a Porter installation, so that
						if one person installs an app in a new environment on Monday, another team member can see
						what was done, and pick up where they left off without a handoff.
						
						* You could also use bundles for a side project. I don't know about you but when I work on
						a project, one weekend I'll figure out how to setup all the infrastructure, configure the
						secrets for my application, only to get distracted. Tear it all down so I'm not paying for 
						it when I'm not developing it, and then try to pick it back up weeks later and by this point,
						I've totally forgotten how to get a working installation of my app. With a bundle I can capture
						all that deployment logic in the bundle, and not lose any progress. I can just re-run porter install,
						and I'm all set up again.

						That's really what it comes down to for me. It's why I like bundles. I can ship not just
						a binary or docker image with an installation guide. I can just ship an entire installer
						that has all the tools it needs, and knows how to do a proper installation, not just what's
						easiest to document (come on you know that there's a gap between the two).
