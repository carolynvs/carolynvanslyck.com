Hi, I'm Carolyn Van Slyck a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft.

Today I want to think through how we can have our cake and eat it too. 

(PAUSE)

Namely I want to install software quickly AND securely.

I have to admit that I'm a sucker for running an installation script by using curl | bash.

I know that I shouldn't... but it's so easy and I'm so lazy!

This laziness extends beyond just installing dev tools on my laptop.

A lot of cloud native software could benefit from having a more straightforward installation process.

Common wisdom says that curling a script and piping it to bash isn't safe, so that's out.

But what if we could make installers that are as easy to use as curl | pipe, but were a whole lot more safe?

First, let's talk about what "curl | bash" is.

That's when you copy/paste a command that looks like the one here.

We all use scripts like this because they quickly install software that you aren't familiar with.

Curl downloads the script, and then the script contents are "piped" to bash where they are immediately executed.

Personally I really like installation scripts:

* I can copy/paste my way to victory with just a single command.

* They require little to no knowledge of the installation logic or tooling.

* And yeah, I believe that the project maintainers can automate the installation better than me on the first try.

(NOD)

Let's review though why using curl | bash is a security risk.

(SLIDE)

What if someone on the internet offered to help install an application you wanted and they would do it for you.

All you need to do is hand over your laptop for 5 seconds, they'll type super fast and boom, it's installed.

I don't know about you, but I don't hand over my laptop to my husband and I _trust him_.

Mostly.

When we think about handing over your laptop to a stranger, its easy to see why its risky.

They would have access to everything on there: documents, pictures, environment variables containing security tokens and passwords, you're logged into a bunch of sites, maybe even your work VPN.

It's clear they could do anything with your laptop that you yourself could do.

That doesn't change when you switch from a physical laptop to a quick copy/paste of an installation script.

When you use magic installation scripts, you are giving the script full access to your laptop and anything your laptop has access to.

Oops.
