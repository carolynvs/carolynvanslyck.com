* Explain what gophersource is (later?)
  * hype
  * support
  * landing page
* Why I'm doing gophersource in the first place
  * building the community that I needed when I first began, and also what I need today
  * I've done it wrong, many many times
  * Often asked how to do it right
  * Go community is often heralded as being awesome because of some of our great people,
    let's figure out how to scale them, and replicate what they do.
  * I want people to be more informed about both the realities of open source,
    understand their own motivations for being in it, and how to do it in a
    sustainable way.
* why oss
  * newbies
  * senior devs
* communities
  * network effect (personal anecdote about me getting into OSS)
  * mentors
  * remote friendly
  * not tied to company
* Messaging gap
  We currently focus on how to contribute instead of how to become a member of the community
  * example of a contributor who is contributing to the community
  * example of a contributor who is contributing to the code
* ladder
* for maintainers
  * why recruit?
  * why community build?
  * when to NOT do these things?
* Safety Net - Water Wings - Bowling with Bumpers
  * setting expectations for contributors
  * setting boundaries for maintainers
* case study: Go
  * I'd love to see Go build a different type of community. Right now I'd call
    it hub and spoke. Go is controlled by the Go team. You can contribute on their
    terms, it is not a democratic community.
  * example of a project instead of a community in some ways
* case study: kubernetes
  * huge community, overwhelming, lots of great community leaders, working on
    supporting both our maintainers and the new contributors better.
  * Anyone can not only contribute but become a leader regardless of their background.
  * Democratic
* case study: service catalog
  * Great new contributor experience
  * Brittle support for maintainers
  * Big bus factor
  * community added after the project was developed
* case study: athens
  * Great new contributor experience
  * Many maintainers, clear path to becoming a leader
  * Things mostly keep moving when Aaron is out, but we could still do more
    to empower and support maintainers to make decisions.
  * The community and the project grew at the same time instead of as an afterthought.
  * Good pattern to follow. Still using it as an incubator for ideas.
* case study: vim-go

* GopherSource Next Steps
  * Engage with more projects and maintainers
  * Build up more content, scale Carolyn ;-)
  * Keep iterating on techniques and refining (deciding what's repeatable)
* Action Items
  * Decide for yourself how you want to fit into OSS
  * Reevaluate how to make it sustainable and healthy for you
  * Try out some of these ideas as you join a new project, or interact with people on your own projects
  * Reach out to me if you are a project who would like to be listed on the site.
